**Day-of-Month Seasonality** is now available on the [landing page](https://www.statsviz.com/). This offers users the ability to examine daily performance of financial instruments and associated statistics, complementing the existing monthly seasonality view.

### Key Insights from FXB Analysis:
- **A reminder** that log returns are additive which is one of the [main reasons to use it](./2024-10-23-why-log-returns.md). 
- **Negative Returns at the Start of the Month:** The day-of-month seasonality chart for FXB reveals a distinct pattern of negative mean log returns during the first few days of the month. While this might initially appear to be a promising trading signal, it is important to note that this pattern is common among dividend-paying ETFs. FXB typically goes ex-dividend on the first of the month, with dividend payouts occurring around the 7th to 9th. This timing likely drives the early-month declines, as the dividend adjustment impacts the price.
- **Mid-Month Stability and End-of-Month Strength:** After the early dip, mid-month returns stabilize with modest averages, while the end of the month often shows an uptick in returns although accompanied by higher variability.

### Implications:
Despite the noticeable early-month decline, it is unlikely that this effect is tradeable due to its association with dividend adjustmentsâ€”a known and expected event. This insight underscores the importance of understanding not just patterns, but the underlying reasons behind them to avoid false signals.

### Why Focus on Day-Level Insights?
While monthly seasonality offers a broad overview, day-of-month seasonality provides a more detailed perspective of the trading environment. This insight allows traders to fine-tune their strategies and adapt to specific intra-month patterns.
